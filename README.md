so the main tools I added to my site are: 
1.Alpha vantage for the api and all data being pulled 
2.matplotlib for plotting the data into a graph 
3.I used flask as well for redirects, rendering templates 
4.And then to help convert my data I used pandas

Site is still in progress and will add more as I continue.
